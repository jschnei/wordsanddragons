4 layers description

actors - things that you can interact with
obstacles - other collidable objects
surface - exactly the set of tiles that you can walk on (make sure you leave unreachable tiles empty)
background - tiles in the background


properties list

background, surface, obstacles - tileset: tileset file (e.g. "tileset.png"), this is mandatory

actors
doors - type:door, destMap: name of level to spawn to (without the .tmx extension), destObject: name of object to spawn to on that level
spawns - type:spawn, right now these are only used as spawn points for doors
start - type:spawn, name:start, if you spawn on this map without being sent from a door, this is where you spawn
npcs - type:npc, image: image file (e.g. "bob.png"), onInteract: name of script in NPCScripts that should be run when pressing Z, onSpeak: name of script that should be run when you "say" something to the NPC, customHeight/customWidth: if you want to resize the image, note: onInteract and onSpeak are not mandatory and if you leave them out then nothing will happen if you try to interact

Note: onInteract and onSpeak are kind of poorly named, in that onInteract is used for dialogue and onSpeak is used for other interactions
Note 2: the npc type is probably going to be used for items and other things that are not necessarily characters oops
